GUInity is a 3D component-based game engine. Itâ€™s a personal project to better understand how game engines work under the hood, practice C++ in a large project and work 3rd-party libraries integration.

##### Challenges:

- Being involved in all parts of a game engine, from loading assets out of the file system to rendering and libraries integration
- Balance between bringing more features and optimization

##### Takeaways:

- Integration with several 3rd-party libraries (OpenGL/FMOD/PhysX/FBX SDK/FreeType)
- Cross-platform (Windows/Mac)
- Apart from the libraries, built the engine in C++ from scratch
- C++11 concepts
- OpenGL concepts
- 3D Math

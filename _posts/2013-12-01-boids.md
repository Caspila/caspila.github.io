This is an implementation of the [Boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) algorithm, described by Craig W. Reynolds. It simulates an organic AI that similar to the behaviour seen in the flocking of birds or fishes. Because the traditional Boids algorithm lacks a Manager and each boid must know about all the other ones, the octree spatial division was implemented to reduce the time for finding boids close to each other. In the video above, two types of fishes are positioned randomly in the world and tend to flock with fishes of their own type as time goes by. This project was developed in Unity3D using C#.

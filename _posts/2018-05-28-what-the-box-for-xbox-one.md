<i>What the Box?</i> is a shooter-style game released on Steam by Bitten Toast Games Inc. that went viral and was played by some of the most popular YouTubers out there. I took over the port to Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, which involved remaking the game in Unreal Engine 4 (the original game was made in Unity) using the existing assets and handling all contacts with Microsoft and Nintendo for Certification and Lot Check.

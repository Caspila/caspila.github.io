<i>Tell-Tale Heart</i> is a first person exploration narrative game and an effort to tackle the problem of linear gameplay and storyline that most games provide. Players finds themselves in the middle of a police investigation in a beautiful, yet mysterious and uncanny world based on Edgar Alan Poe’s stories. They have to explore their surroundings to unravel the mysteries that it presents while being interrogated by suspicious cops and slowly losing their own sanity on each misstep taken.

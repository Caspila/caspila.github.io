<i>Duraldeâ€™s Mission</i> is a virtual reality experience that was designed to explore immersion and communication. The player takes the role of an astronaut that is on a mission to test the first ship that has the capability of hyperspace traveling. The operator helps players complete the mission by talking to them over a headset, running them through the mission procedures and solving eventual problems. This project was developed for the Immersive Environments course attended during my masters at the [CDM](http://thecdm.ca/people/students/guilherme-cunha).

##### Roles/Tasks:

- Programming

##### Challenges:

- Virtual reality experiences are harder to develop than standard games because players are not used to the device. Most of the times this leads to unpleasant experiences, motion sickness and discomfort.

##### Takeaways:

- Best practices for developing virtual reality experiences
- User testing through clear and thought out hypothesis

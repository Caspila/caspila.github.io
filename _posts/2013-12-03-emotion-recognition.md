**Abstract:** Facial expressions provide a high amount of information about a person, making the ability to interpret them a high valued task that can be used in several fields of Informatics, such as Human Machine Interface, Digital Games, interactive storytelling and digital TV/Cinema. This dissertation discusses the process of recognizing emotions in real time using ASM (Active Shape Model) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) and presents a comparison between two commonly used ways when extracting the attributes: neutral face and average. As such comparison can not be found in the literature, the results presented are valuable to the development of applications that deal with emotion expression in real time. The current study considers six types of emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and disgust.

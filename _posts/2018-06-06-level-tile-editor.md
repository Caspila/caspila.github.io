A plugin that makes it easier to create levels that are grid-based. Instead of placing sprites on a grid, it places Prefabs, which allows for quick creation of levels since each object retains the components and properties, such as colliders, custom scripts, and others. Because it’s not limited to sprites, it can work with both 2D and 3D tiles.

The editor can be extended by creating custom brushes and descriptors. Included examples are 9-slice, pipe tiles, directional and contextual tiles. On top of that, it’s easy to add your own logic for whatever custom behavior is needed.

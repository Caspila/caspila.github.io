Game developed for the Ludum Dare 31, a 72-hour international game jam. I was the developer of the game and was very pleased with the final result. It was the first Ludum Dare that the team took part (some of the team members had never participated in any jam whatsoever) but we got awesome ratings, in particular, #8 in the fun category.

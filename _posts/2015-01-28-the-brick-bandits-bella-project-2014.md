Game developed during the [Bella Project](http://www.thebellaproject.org/) Game Jam in 2014 Vancouver, Canada. The objective of this jam was to create games to make the lives of cystic fibrosis patients more tolerable by providing entertainment during one of their day-to-day treatment procedures. This was one of the noblest projects Iâ€™ve taken part. The game receives input from a device connected to a mask and indicates if the patient is doing the treatment the right way.

##### The Game:

In <i>Brick Bandits</i> patients have to steal as many bricks as possible from the train by aiming and breathing according to the treatment. In the second stage of the game, players can incrementally build a persistent world with the bricks that were stolen.

##### Roles/Tasks:

- Programmer

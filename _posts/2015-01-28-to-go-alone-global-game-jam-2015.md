*To go Alone* was a game/experience developed for the Global Game Jam 2015, a 48 international game jam. The team wanted to step out of their comfort zone and try something outside of the “kill orcs, get gold” game loop. In *To go Alone* The player tries to find Koko with only a star map available to guide themselves through a seemingly infinite forest at night. It’s a minimalist game that relies heavily on visuals, storytelling, and audio to attempt a real emotional connection with the players. The team was very pleased with what we accomplished in such a short time.

One interesting concept that we used was that the spots the player had to reach have no fixed location. We decided that early on because with only a star map in hands, the player’s orientation becomes much less accurate. To prevent backtracking and increased player frustration, we developed such landmarks in a way that they are placed procedurally whenever the player walks a certain distance in the right direction.

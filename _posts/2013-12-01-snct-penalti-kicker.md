Penalty Kicker’s objective is to be joyful and educational at the same time, providing knowledge to the players. At the beginning of the game, a 2014 Soccer World Cup host city is randomly chosen and the player has to answer three questions about this city and soccer in general. After each question answered correctly, the soccer soccer player moves closer to the ball finally leading to a goal kick based on the users touch input on the screen.

This game was exhibited at the [Semana Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia](http://semanact.mct.gov.br/) (National Week of Science and Technology) 2013 placed in Brasilia. The project was developed using Unity3D and C#.

<h4 style="text-align: center;margin: 0px auto;display; block;">Software Engineer / Game Developer</h4>

<br>
I’ve always demonstrated great interest in games ever since I started my undergrad in Computer Science. The passion only grew as I constantly attended to game jams and developed small games and prototypes as personal projects. I’ve now been working professionally with games for over 8 years.

Versatile background as a generalist, good foundations of C# and C++, Unity, and Unreal Engine 4. Experience both as a tool programmer in AAA environment and solo programmer in multiple shipped indie titles, including multiplayer games. Experience also with Xbox and Switch development and their certification processes.

I’m currently working at <i>Warner Bros Games Montreal</i>.
